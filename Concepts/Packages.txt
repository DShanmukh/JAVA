Packages :-
--------------
to reduces the code and comlexicity.
for clarity.
naming problems.

                                                                  Packages :-
Definition:-
Package is a collections of classes , interfaces and subpackages
Advantages:-
1).Reusablity:
the class contained in the package of another program can easily reused
2).name conflicts:
 packages helps us to uniquely identify class ,for Example 
we can have company.sales.Employeeand company.marketing.Employee classes
 3).Maintainces:-
with packages we can organize the project  in the better way.
predefined packages:-
the packages which are created by the java developer are called predefined packages.
EX:-
  java.util  -> it includes the classes  and interfaces for utility purpose. 
                    Ex:-array,scanner,strack.
  java.lang-> it includes the  calsses and interfaces related languages fundamentals
                   EX:-string ,math,integer,character...
 java.io->   it includes  related to  input and output functionality.
EX:-file reader,bufferedreader
java.awt-> It includes classes and interfaces related to design GUI applications.
Ex:-  button
java.net ->  It includes classes and interfaces related to network applications.
         inetaddress,URL.......
how to import the predefined packages :-
1)import packagename.subpackagename.classname;
ex:-
        import java.util.Scanner;
2) import packagename.subpackagename.*;
ex:-
       import java.util.*;
import java.util.Date;
class Date1
{
public static void main (String args[])
{
 Date  d=new Date();
 System.out.println(d);
System.out.println(d.getDate());
}
}
1.make easy searching or location of class and interfaces.
2.avoid naming conflicts.
3.implements data encapsulation (or ) data -hiding.
4.provie controlled access : the access specifier protected and default have access control in packages.
